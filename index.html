(Introduction to a project 


Transport is an integral part of our social living.  The modern society cannot run without   transport   facilities.   There are   many   companies  who   give   transport services   to  the   individual   and   corporate clients.  In   the   EID   system,  the EID is an online platform in which client can use it as tool to communicate with drivers which will help the user to get them to there specified location and same applies for the driver where driver will get an interface where he/she will be specifying there future traveling plan and if any user is interested to join them and give driver a certain fare and through  this both the parties can get there job done  and will facilitate both the client and the company with reduced time, efforts,money . First the company will register his vehicles and the vehicles to the system. Then the client   will   request   for   booking   a   vehicle   on   his   required   date   and   time, providing   all   necessary   information.   The   fare   will   be   calculated by the driver   and   client should confirm or bargain  or reject the offer  . Then the employee will serve the client on the specific date and time.)

    Scope Of Work

The main aim of the proposed system is to reduce the redudancy avilable in the current system and this project’s aim is to automate the system, collecting all necessary information of the client and then serve the client. The data used by the system is stored in a database that will be the   center  of all information held clients and employees and the base for the remainder of the process after the initial application has been made. This enables things to be simplified and considerably quickened, making the jobs of the people involved easier. It supports the current process but centralizes it and makes it possible for decisions to be made earlier and easier way

page14{Proposed system}
(
    Proposed system
EID’s mission is to make transportation reliable and easy. They work  with complex data, high traffic, and complex systems, all bundled up in  their phone . EID enables drives to book drivers  for clients. Eid drivers use personal cars or borrowed car registered in the fill up form , and both customers  and drivers communicate using the EId software.
There are two kinds of users that our system should account for: Drivers and Customers.
·	Drivers must be able to frequently notify the service regarding their current location and availability
·	Passengers should be able to see all nearby drivers in real-time
·	Customers can request a ride using a destination and pickup time.
·	Nearby drivers are then notified when a customer needs pick up.
·	Once a ride is accepted, both the driver and customer must constantly see the other’s current location the duration of the trip.
·	One the drive is complited feedback is show to them

page15{Advantages of Proposed System}
(
    Computerizing  the  current  system  with  the  help  of  new  software  with  help  of  new 
software provide following advantages: 
·	  Due to advance technology faster computer means more speedy work. 
·	  As the computers are highly accurate, accuracy in work is increased. 
·	 Storage of large volume of data is facilitated due to high storage capacity of computers. 
·	Decrease the load of the person involved in existing system due to automation of task. 
·	  Updating of information is easily. 
·	  Access any information individual.
·	  Easy and fast retrieval of information. 
·	  Because of related database provide by NoSQL , the data will be consistent. 
·	  Overall time is saved and activities can be performed in parallel.

)
page16{Some of the Brief Better features of the proposed system are given below: }
(
     ·	Removal of Data Redundancy 
     ·	 Data Consistency 
     ·	Data Security 
     ·	 Help in storing and retrieving records

     

Removal of Data Redundancy 

Due to the non relational database there is no interconnection between them so there is less processing going in between then and data is stored in Json Format so it is easy to transfer and quick transfr of data and there is primary key ID which is unique and references are thee in field which makes data les redudand This will cause easy data recording and low time consuming. 




Data Security 

MongoDB Atlas makes it easy to control access to your database. Your  database instances are deployed in a unique Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)  to ensure network isolation. Other security features include IP  whitelisting or VPC Peering, always-on authentication, encryption at  rest and encryption in transit, sophisticated role-based access  management, and more.







Always on and durable

With MongoDB Atlas, your self-healing clusters are made up of geographically distributed database instances to ensure no single point of failure. Want even better availability guarantees? Get multi-region fault tolerance by enabling cross-region replication. MongoDB Atlas also includes powerful features to enhance reliability for your mission-critical production databases, such as continuous backups and point-in-time recovery.





Fully automated and elastic

MongoDB Atlas automates infrastructure provisioning, setup, and deployment so your teams can get the database resources they need, when they need them. Patches and minor version upgrades are applied automatically. And when you need to modify your cluster — whether it’s to scale out or perform an upgrade — MongoDB Atlas lets you do so in a few clicks with no downtime window required.

Security Requirements 
Some of the factors that are identified to protect the software from accidental or
malicious   access,   use,   modification,   destruction,   or   disclosure   are   described
below. Specific requirements in this area could include the need to: 
 Utilize certain cryptographic techniques 
 Keep specific log or history data sets 
 Assign certain functions to different modules 
 Restrict communications between some areas of the program 
 Check data integrity for critical variables 
 Later version of the software will incorporate encryption techniques in
the user/license authentication process. 
 The software will include an error tracking log that will help the user
understand what error occurred when the application crashed along with
suggestions on how to prevent the error from occurring again. 
·	 Communication needs to be restricted when the application is validating
the user or license. (i.e., using https)

   Model–view–controller (usually known as MVC) is a software design patterncommonly used for developing user interfaces that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.
    Traditionally used for desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs), this pattern has become popular for designing web applications. Popular programming languages have MVC frameworks that facilitate implementation of the pattern.
